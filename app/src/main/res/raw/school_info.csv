Under the auspices of the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and Learning for Life Programme (LLP), students go through level-wide activities to broaden their learning in the two focused areas.  Those with the aptitude or interest may also progress to our customized activities for more in-depth learning.  In the area of Science, for instance, students go through a range of activities from life-sciences, use of customized gadgets to investigate scientific concepts, to the application of theories in the design of toys.  Platforms have also been provided for students to apply their learning in the creation of toys/artefacts using science concepts, which are subsequently sold to raise funds for selected beneficiaries.    With regard to the development of Aesthetics, students are exposed to voice-training, dance, playing of musical instruments, to the use of ICT for manga art and 2D animations.  Through the programme, students are exposed to an array of alternative platforms to express their thoughts and ideas.  It is hoped that through the wide range of offerings and the strong foundation that is laid, Rosythians will acquire a broad and deep foundation for a lifelong and life-deep learning."

Our overarching goal is for our staff and pupils to strive for both excellence and wellbeing, and for our school community to thrive and flourish.  Learning is delivered with positive engagement so as to invite every pupil on a journey of discovery and holistic development.  Discipline is promoted in a respectful way to engender self-reflection and growth.  By emphasising positive motivation and affirmative attitudes, we nurture an awareness of greatness and potential in each and every staff and pupil, as they set personalised goals and ultimately demonstrate creative expression, problem-solving, and meaningful achievement.    In keeping with the philosophy of Positive Education, Westwood Primary's Staff Belief is that Every One is a Talented and Unique Individual with Potential for Success. Our Westwood School Culture is one of care, love and drive, and we aspire in going the extra mile in everything we do.  To enable all staff and pupils to believe that he or she can be an agent of change, with opportunities to use his or her talents and skills to benefit others, our positive school culture is grounded in our core values of A Heart of Gratitude, A Resilient Mindset, A Passion for Community and A Future-Ready Confidence.  A THRIVE Framework for Positive Education has been developed to ensure that school policies, practices and programmes are aligned to the six key domains of positive accomplishment (Thinking mindfully); positive health (Healthy coping); positive relationship (Relating well); positive engagement (In the moment); positive meaning (Values-driven actions); and positive emotions (Emotions of positivity).

Learning for Life Programme (Student Leadership & Community Service): Throughout their time in Westwood Primary, every child is given an opportunity for leadership, and comprehensive training and mentoring is provided to support each child is their leadership journey. Westwoodians are also given many opportunities to give back to their community via class-wide and level-wide programmes.   Holistic Learning, Assessment and Reporting: Westwood Primary has adopted a whole-school approach towards holistic assessment, aligning PERI-HA practices with its founding philosophy of Positive Education. Formative Assessment (FA) practices are adopted in all classrooms, so as to promote learner engagement and ensure every child has a voice. Positive questioning and process praise help children to focus on the process of learning.  Westwood Primary also engages parents in Holistic Assessment, via the annual Teacher-Parent-Pupil Conference, where pupils share what and how they have learnt with their parents, prompting authentic discussions that involve each child in personalised learning.

We will continue to inculcate the right values in our students and equip them with knowledge and skills so as to prepare them to face the challenges of the future. Through comprehensive academic and co-curricular programmes, anchored on student centric and values-driven learning, we hope to nurture the students to achieve their potential. At the end of their 6 years in MPS, we want to see our students grow to become Responsible Learners and Compassionate Leaders ready to serve community and nation as active young citizens.  OUR SCHOOL VALUES The school values are encapsulated in the acronym #R#IC#E# (Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Commitment, Care and Esprit de Corps). Like a staple diet, R#IC#E is infused into both the formal and informal curriculum of the school.  OUR SCHOOL MOTTO The school motto #Ilmu Suluh Hidup# (translated to mean #Knowledge lights up our Lives#), as reflected in the school crest, continues to be of relevance today. The white represents virtue and good character, while the blue is symbolic of a peaceful and harmonious environment. The four interlocking rings represent our closely-knit multi-racial school population working in harmony. The stalk of padi is symbolic of hard work and effort required for success. The star reflects the belief we have that every student can achieve and education (symbolized by the pen), will blaze the way (as shown by the torch) for our students.",WOODLANDS,NORTH,NORTH 5,GOVERNMENT SCHOOL,CO-ED SCHOOL,SINGLE SESSION,PRIMARY,No,No,No,No,Chinese,Malay,Tamil,"COMMUNITY SERVICE & STUDENT LEADERSHIP LEAD (Learn, Engage, Absorb, Demonstrate) to Serve @ MPS  In MPS, we share a common belief in nurturing responsible learners and compassionate leaders who can learn, lead and serve.

This is espoused in our Citizenship and Character Education or CCE#s vision of #Every Marsilian a Service Leader and Green Citizen#.   To foster a student-centric, values-driven learning environment, CCE in Marsiling Primary is anchored on two core programmes # Values in Action (VIA) and student leadership vis-#-vis Green Citizenship & LEAD to SERVE respectively. VIA is practised through our Green Citizenship programme which engages students in initiating collective actions among peers in doing simple acts of taking care of the school and environment.  The school#s student leadership programme #LEAD to Serve@MPS# focuses on developing the individual capacity to lead and influence others with respect, responsibility, care and appreciation."

The Drama Programme seeks to develop students into confident communicators and reflective thinkers who are able to challenge common perceptions and stereotypical perspectives. The Malay Elective Programme in Malay Language for Secondary Schools (EMAS) provides opportunities for students to develop a deeper appreciation of the Malay Language and culture. The Cultural Flexibility Programme seeks to develop students who are culturally astute, attuned to the socio-political and economic pulse of the region, yet committed to Singapore. At the same time, the Service and Student Leadership Programme integrates leadership development with community outreach and action, so that students imbibe the qualities and attitudes of a servant leader. In this way, we hope to nurture citizens who are socially aware, informed about local and international issues, and able and ready to make a difference to the community and people around them. The annual Anderson Sabbatical provides opportunities for students from all levels to step out of their comfort zone to challenge themselves by building resilience, working in teams, and developing initiative and self-reliance. All in all, there is a strong focus on experiential learning in our academic and non-academic curriculum as we seek to actively engage our students in constructing, integrating and deepening their learning experiences."

The Fairfield curriculum is undergirded by the WHEEL philosophy to provide Fairsians with holistic, enriched and experiential learning. We strongly believe that education should go beyond the boundaries of the syllabuses and that students should be given a chance to explore beyond the classroom. We also believe that students should be engaged in meaningful and authentic experiences so that deep learning can occur when they reflect, connect the dots and seek to apply what they have learned in a real world context. The Fairfield curriculum also seeks to develop strong moral and performance character as we nurture leaders with a strong personal voice who can exert a gracious and positive influence on the community.",QUEENSTOWN,SOUTH,SOUTH 2,GOVERNMENT-AIDED SCH,CO-ED SCHOOL,SINGLE SESSION,SECONDARY,No,Yes,No,No,Chinese,Malay,Tamil,"Aligned with the WHEEL philosophy, one signature programme of the school is the Fairfield Learning Experience (FLEX) week which is set aside for students to learn outside the classroom.
